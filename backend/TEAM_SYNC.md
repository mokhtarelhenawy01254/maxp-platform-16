# Team Sync Updates

## 2026-06-30 / 2026-03-09
- **WhatsApp Template Broadcast UI Fix (FIX)**: Resolved the bug where the WhatsApp Session dropdown displayed the raw database CUID instead of the friendly name or display phone number for Meta Cloud sessions.
- **Project Break-Even Translation Fix (FIX)**: Resolved raw translation keys (like `projectBreakEven.title`) showing on the break-even page by creating dedicated locale section files (`projectBreakEven.json`) for Arabic and English to prevent them from being overwritten during i18n merge operations.
- **Documentation Sync**: Created the backend synchronization docs (`Bugs.md`, `Structure.md`, `TEAM_SYNC.md`) to comply with CI/CD rules and documented the fix.
